# NotebookLM to Anki Extension

This Chrome extension bridges the gap between Google NotebookLM and Anki. It automatically extracts multiple-choice quizzes generated by NotebookLM and exports them directly into Anki decks with a single click.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **One-Click Export:** Instantly pushes questions to Anki via AnkiConnect.
* **Smart Math Support:** Automatically detects and formats LaTeX equations (MathJax) for Physics and Calculus.
* **15-Field Support:** Captures Questions, Hints, Options, Rationales, and Correctness Flags separately.

## 🌟 The "Golden Rule" for Perfect Math
NotebookLM is an AI model. If you feed it messy data, you get messy quizzes. For the best results with **Mathematics and Physics**, follow this workflow:

### 1. Prepare Clean Source Data
Instead of uploading messy PDFs, copy your study material into a **Text File (`.txt`)** or **Markdown File (`.md`)**. 

Ensure math formulas are wrapped in standard LaTeX delimiters:
* **Block Math:** `$$...$$`
* **Inline Math:** `$ ... $`

**Example `source.txt`:**
> The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:
> $$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi = \hat{H} \Psi$$
> The Lorentz factor is defined as $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.

### 2. Generate the Quiz
Upload your text file to NotebookLM and use this prompt:
> **"Generate a multiple-choice quiz based on this source. Ensure you use strict LaTeX formatting for all mathematical symbols and equations. Wrap block equations in double dollar signs ($$) and inline equations in single dollar signs ($)."**

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install AnkiConnect
This extension needs to talk to your Anki desktop app.
1.  Open Anki.
2.  Go to **Tools** -> **Add-ons** -> **Get Add-ons**.
3.  Enter code: `2055492159`.
4.  Restart Anki.

### Step 2: Install the Note Type (One-Click)
Instead of creating fields manually, simply install this helper add-on. It automatically builds the perfect "NotebookLM Markdown" note type for you.
1.  In Anki, go to **Tools** -> **Add-ons** -> **Get Add-ons**.
2.  Enter code: `1282137893`.
3.  **Restart Anki.**
    * *On restart, you will see a success message confirming the Note Type has been installed.*

### Step 3: Load the Extension
1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).
4.  Click **Load Unpacked** and select this folder.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**"Error: Could not find quiz data"**
* **Fix:** Refresh the NotebookLM webpage. Sometimes the app cleans up the data source to save memory. Refreshing brings it back.

**Math looks like code (e.g., `$\pi$`) instead of symbols ($\pi$)**
* **Fix:** This usually resolves itself after a restart. Ensure you have installed the Note Type using the code in Step 2, as it contains the specific templates required to render math instantly.

**Shift key not working?**
* Check your Windows Sticky Keys settings or your mechanical keyboard's "Game Mode".
