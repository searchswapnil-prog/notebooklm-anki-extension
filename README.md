NotebookLM to Anki Extension: User GuideThis extension extracts quizzes from Google NotebookLM and exports them directly to Anki using the NotebookLM Markdown note type.🌟 The "Golden Rule" for Perfect MathNotebookLM is an AI. If you feed it messy PDFs, it generates messy quizzes. If you feed it clean text with LaTeX, it generates perfect quizzes.For the best results with Mathematics and Physics, follow this workflow:1. Prepare Your Source DataInstead of uploading raw PDFs, copy the text you want to learn into a Text File (.txt) or Markdown File (.md).Ensure your math formulas are wrapped in standard LaTeX delimiters:Block Math (Separate line): $$...$$Inline Math (Inside text): $ ... $Example Source (source.txt):PlaintextThe time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:
$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi = \hat{H} \Psi $$

The Lorentz factor is defined as $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.
2. Upload & GenerateUpload your .txt file to NotebookLM.Use this specific prompt to generate the quiz (Copy & Paste):"Generate a multiple-choice quiz based on this source. Ensure you use strict LaTeX formatting for all mathematical symbols and equations. Wrap block equations in double dollar signs ($$) and inline equations in single dollar signs ($)."3. Verify & ExportLook at the chat window. If you see the math formatted correctly (or as LaTeX code), the data is ready.Click the Anki Export button injected by this extension.The extension will automatically:Scrape the data.Clean the formatting.Push it to Anki via AnkiConnect.🛠️ Setup Requirements1. AnkiConnectYou must have the AnkiConnect add-on installed in Anki to allow the browser to talk to your desktop app.Code: 2055492159Status: Anki must be open and running in the background.2. Note TypeYou must have the "NotebookLM Markdown" Note Type created in Anki with the following 15 fields (Order is critical):QuestionHintArchDiagramOption1Rationale1Flag1Option2Flag2Rationale2Option3Flag3Rationale3Option4Flag4Rationale4⚠️ Troubleshooting"Error: Could not find quiz data"Fix: Refresh the NotebookLM webpage. Sometimes the app hides the data after a long session. Refreshing brings it back to the source code.Math looks like code (e.g., $\pi$) instead of symbols ($\pi$)Fix: This is usually a template timing issue. Ensure you are using the latest Front Template provided in this repository, which contains the forceMathRender() script to trigger MathJax immediately.Shift key not working?Check your Windows Sticky Keys settings or your mechanical keyboard's "Game Mode".Version: 9.0 (Smart Math Detection)Author: swapnil
